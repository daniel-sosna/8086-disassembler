# Disassembler

## About the project
This project is an optional assignment for the subject "Computer Architecture" of the course "Software Engineering" at Vilnius University.

The program is written entirely in assembler. It disassembles the machine code from a given file into instructions for the Intel 8086 microprocessor. The program understands only .COM format, which has no structure, it is just a flat binary.
